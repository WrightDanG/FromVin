                <p>Step 1</p>
                <p>Appearance</p>
                <p>Assess the colour and clarity, preferably against a plan background. Any brown tinges may suggest
                    that the wine is corked (has gone off). A light colour will suggest a bright and fruity flavour
                    where a deep colour may lead you to expect a rich, earthy or mineraly note.</p>

                <p>Step 2</p>
                <p>Nose</p>
                <p>Swirl the wine in the glass (don't worry, it takes practice to get perfect!) and smell the aromas. If
                    there is a vinegar-y smell then the wine has gone bad. Otherwise, you should be able to get a feel
                    for how the wine will taste based on the scent profile. If you can detect those aromas strongly as
                    you move your nose away from the glass, you can be assured that the wine has quality to it. </p>

                <p>Taste</p>
                <p>Take a sip of the wine. Hold it in your mouth and let a little air in there too. This will enhance
                    the flavours. You're looking to feel the flavours on your tongue, the tannins on your cheeks and
                    roof of mouth, and once you have swallowed or spat - how long the taste lingers. Get a feel for the
                    flavours and the scent together and try to pull out what kinds of flavour notes you can find. </p>

                <p>Draw Conclusions</p>
                <p>Once you have a feel for the qualities of the wine in question, you can start to pair it with food. A
                    good pairing will enhance the good qualities of both the wine and the food. Whilst there are
                    infinite combinations of wine and food, when it comes to cheese we've done the hard work for you!
